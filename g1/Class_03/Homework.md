## Homework

 For this homework we would like you to expand already created Pizza Model, with property like Ingredients. Create your own model like Store (each store can have different amount and types of pizzas). Try to change some of the alredy existing properties in Order model (User and Pizza to be of type int and be UserId and PizzaId)
 
 As a bonus: Implement all of the controllers :D
