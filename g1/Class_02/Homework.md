## Homework

 As we did everything with USER on the class, implement exactly the same scenario but now instead
 of USER, implement all functionality with PizzaModel, PizzaControler and of course
 views for PizzaController.
 
 Bonus*
  Implement the delete functionality of specific User on project from the class
  (Ognen's idea :P )
