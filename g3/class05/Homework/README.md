LIBRARY APP

- Create new ASP.NET Core MVC 2.1 application
- Set the default settings, so the application can work properly
- Create User and Book models
- Create a StaticDB class with Users and Books that will be seeded when the app starts
- You will need to decide the logic between Users and Books
- Crate end to end feature where clients will be able to see all the users registered in the database with all the books they own
- Library has unlimited copies of the books :)
