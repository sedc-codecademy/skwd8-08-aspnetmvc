- Create one View with a view model that will have only one property that will be string and will be called Name.
- Create controller with one action that will recieve the value of the name property and will send it to a service.
- Create one service with one method inside that will send the Name to a method in the repository.

- Static Database will have only one collection of strings, and that collection will be Names. 

** Implementing multy tier achitecture and dependency injection is a must **
